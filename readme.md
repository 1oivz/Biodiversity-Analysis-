# Biodiversity-Analysis-

Analysis of animal biodiversity.  
We analyse endangered species and their different states.  
We seek to obtain different ideas like:

1. In which category are the most animals found.
2. Different conservation statuses.
3. Percentage of protected species.
4. The relationship between different variables such as type of animal (mammal, reptile, bird...) and its probability of being in danger of extinction.


As i am an Spanish guy, some of the comments about what i'm doing with certain code are in Spanish. 

Any criticism or advice is welcome, feel free to contribute in order to improve all the analyses. 

This is the beginning of the road.

Thank you.
